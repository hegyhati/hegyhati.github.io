<p>
    For me, working with clever and enthusiastic students on a diploma project is one if not the best part of being an academic. 
    Thus, my door is always open to students who are considering to have me as a supervisor for this important part of their higher education. 
    I'm utterly proud and happy to have been involved with <a href="/teaching_supervision.html#supervision">many wonderful diploma works</a>, and cherish the time spent with the students who prepared them. 
</p>

<p>
    The goal of this page is to provide an initial picture for interested studenst about the conditions, expectations and topics involved when doing a diploma project under my supervision. 
    I tried to keep it organized, but most of the aspects are intertwined with each other.
    If you feel, that you can sympathize with these principles, feel encouraged to contact me for a personal discussion. 
    No commitment at this point, obviously, and I'll most definitely guide you towards a colleague, if I see them more fitting for you. 
</p>

<h3>Topic</h3>
<p>
    Probably the most important part of the aforementioned discussion is the topic of the project itself. 
    I roughly categorize possible topics like this:
    <dl>
        <dt>Scheduling related projects</dt>
        <dd>I always have numerous ideas for diploma projects in the field of my research. These topics can have two flavors. Either a more research oriented topic, that requires more abstract thinking and mathematical skills, and more software-developent oriented topics that put the emphasis on developing useful tool for ongoing research. These topics have the highest priority for me. The research-oriented projects have the prospect of participating in student competitions, or being presented at scientific conferences.</dd>
        <dt>Teaching related projects</dt>
        <dd>Similar to the previous category, but only development flavored topics, as I'm not at "research level" expert in most of those fields. The endproduct is usually a tool, that can be useful for students to help them understand easier, deeper the <a href="/teaching_supervision.html#teaching">subjects that I teach</a>. These topics are almost as important for me, as the research related ones.</dd>
        <dt>"Fun" hobby projects</dt>
        <dd>I have my <a href="/index.html#hobby">hobbies</a> outside of the academy, that I'm happy to spend my freetime with. Again, only software development type of projects are plausible. I'm always eager to work on such projects, if I still have "free slots".</dd>
        <dt>Students own idea</dt>
        <dd>These ideas usually have two outcomes. Either they qualify for one of the above, or not. In the latter case, I usually have my hands full enough with projects from the above categories, so that I'd suggest another colleague of mine as a supervisor. However, If I'm free, and feel that I could add value to the project, I'm happy to take it on.</dd>
        <dt>External/Industry projects</dt>
        <dd>The typical scenario is, that a student is already employed by a company, where they found a project, that would be useful for the company and can qualify as a diploma project as well. The real supervisor is the team leader / project manager at the company, and only an "inside" co-supervisor is needed from the University. While these collaborations are praiseworthy, I don't take on such co-supervisor roles aside of very-very rare exceptions.</dd>
    </dl>
</p>

<h3>Quality</h3>
<p>
    In my eyes, a diploma project is an opportunity for the student to learn and experience many new things with the guidance of the supervisor, and his/her goal should be to exploit this opportunity to get as many skills, know-how as possible before starting a career. 
    Thus, I expect my supervised students to be dedicated and hard working, and having the same attitude. 
    If someones goal is to get the degree/certificate with minimal or just sufficient effort, I'm not a good choice for a supervisor. 
    My expectations towards quantity/quality is usually considerably higher than what is needed for the best grade.
</p>
<p>
    I expect hard work and dedication from you. 
    In exchange, I will also do my best to provide the support you need to reach the hights you are capable of. 
    That is the exact reason, why I only accept a small, limited number of students each semester. 
    I rather have 3 students to whom I know I provided valuable insight and help, than to have 10 diploma projects, for each of which I can only allocate a barely sufficient time.
</p>

<h3>Independence and responsibility </h3>

<p>
    In this collaboration I'm a supervisor, not a teacher.
    I don't consider it my job to teach a specific technology that is needed to fulfill the development tasks at hand. 
    Most probably I've never even used it, and I have no idea, what is the best choice from several competing options. 
    At the end of your studies, you have to be ready to do your own research in such situation, make a reasonable selection, and then learn everything necessary based on the content that is available on the web. 
    Obviously, if I have former experience in that specific topic, I'll share that with you, but definitely not spend hours teaching them or finding the best reference documentations or materials.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, I'm not your "motivation coach". 
    I'll do my best to keep you motivated during all the work, but I won't go out of my way to nag you if you don't progress. 
    This is your diploma work, not mine.
    I'm sad, if it stalls, and I'll try to help you resolve whatever issue is blocking you, but I won't put effort in fighting lazyness or disorientation in your daily routines.
</p>

<p>
    I'm also not your superior/boss. 
    There will be decisions, that I'll make based on my experience, but I consider this mostly as a collaboration. 
    I want you to have your opinion, suggestions, and to make decisions for yourself in many questions.
</p>

<h3>English</h3>
<p>
    You must be able to independently read online references, resources, articles, etc., which are 99% of the time in English for IT. 
    I'm happy if you decide to write your thesis in English, but that is not required nor proposed at all. 
    This decision is entirely up to you.
</p>

<h3>Co-supervisor</h3>
<p>
    I'll do my best to find a suiting co-supervisor, who can provide help in things that I can't during a project.
    This is typically someone from my circles, who is an expert in the technologies that you probably will end up using in your project. 
    His or her role ends at answering short questions regarding these technologies, and to provide directions. 
    If you have someone from your circles in mind, I'm happy to have them as co-supervisor. 
</p>

<h3>Administrative duties</h3>
<p>
    Each university has its own administrative procedure that comes with doing a diploma work and finishing the course. 
    This usually mean reports, signed forms, etc. that have to be submitted before a deadline. 
    I'll never keep track of those deadlines for you (see responsibility and indepence above). 
    It is your job to keep me updated, and notify me in time if any buerocratic task is needed on my part.
</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>
<p>
    There is no need to wait for the last semesters to start working on your diploma project. 
    The more time is available, the better the endproduct can be. 
    Obviously, it is probably too early in the first semester, but if we sit down to discuss the topic, I can tell you, if there is something, that you can do as a preparation in advance, or if you need to wait before finishing several classes.
</p>

<h3>Small technical details</h3>
<p>
    There are a few technical requirements if we want to work together:
    <ul>
        <li>Everything must be version controlled on GitHub.</li>
        <li>If it is a software development type of project, you are expected to write tests, and run them in a CI pipeline.</li>
        <li>You will need to write your thesis with LaTeX.</li>
        <li>Many projects involve writing small scripts to automate tasks, etc. You have to be able to do these in your preferred language.</li>
        <li>I expect you to give me weekly report on your progress, even if there was none. If I'm not incapable, I'm also available for you on a weekly basis for discussion.</li>
        <li>I expect you to use state-of-the-art technologies. "I know this one from before" is not a good enough reason to chose a tool.</li>
    </ul>
    A quick note to the mentioned technologies: you are not supposed to know them when you start, but you will have to get familiar with them eventually.
</p>
