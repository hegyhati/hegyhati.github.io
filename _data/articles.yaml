  title: "Waste to energy for small cities: Economics versus carbon footprint"
  abstract: 'The main activities in Waste to Energy processing include waste generation, collection, separation, transportation, conversion, energy distribution, and ultimate waste disposal. Waste to Energy carries a trade-off between energy generation and the energy spent on collection, transport and treatment. Major performance indicators are cost, Waste Energy Potential Utilisation, and Carbon Footprint. This presentation analyses the potential of small cities to substitute part of their fossil fuels use by energy derived from Municipal Solid Waste. Several factors are considered in the study. The impact of waste logistics and the losses from energy distribution systems - natural gas pipeline and electricity grid are the most significant ones on the side of the supply chain. Further, the waste processing part, including the energy recovery from the waste involves the evaluation of a number of technologies linked with each other to form a distributed integrated processing system. In this study, the options for converting waste into thermal energy include (a) biogas digestion and burning and (b) waste incineration with off-gas cleaning. It is also possible to use the biogas in advanced cogeneration systems based on engines or fuel cells. The proposed procedure takes all these options into account and derives the optimal processing configuration from the waste generation to energy supply and residual waste deposition to landfill.'

  title: Colorability of mixed hypergraphs and their chromatic inversions
  abstract: 'We solve a long-standing open problem concerning a discrete mathematical model, which has various applications in computer science and several other fields, including frequency assignment and many other problems on resource allocation. A mixed hypergraph H is a triple (X,C,D) where X is the set of vertices, and C and D are two set systems over X, the families of so-called C-edges and D-edges, respectively. A vertex coloring of a mixed hypergraph H is proper if every C-edge has two vertices with a common color and every D-edge has two vertices with different colors. A mixed hypergraph is colorable if it has at least one proper coloring; otherwise it is uncolorable. The chromatic inversion of a mixed hypergraph H = (X,C,D) is defined as Hc = (X,C,D). Since 1995, it was an open problem wether there is a correlation between the colorability properties of a hypergraph and its chromatic inversion. In this paper we answer this question in the negative, proving that there exists no polynomial-time algorithm (provided that P ≠ NP to decide whether both H and Hc are colorable, or both are uncolorable. This theorem holds already for the restricted class of 3-uniform mixed hypergraphs (i.e., where every edge has exactly three vertices). The proof is based on a new polynomial-time algorithm for coloring a special subclass of 3-uniform mixed hypergraphs. Implementation in C++ programming language has been tested. Further related decision problems are investigated, too. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.'

  title: 'Increasing solar energy utilisation by rescheduling operations with heat and electricity demand'
  abstract: 'For the utilization of renewables, e.g., solar energy, two systems are possible, i.e., direct transfer from the capture system to the process and indirect from capture system through storage to the process with demand. Direct usage is preferable because of its higher efficiency. Mathematical programming for the rescheduling of the operations was used to maximize the direct use of renewable energy and to minimize the need for the energy storage. This reduces the consumption of utilities with a higher impact on the environment by exploiting an inherent flexibility of the processes on the demand side. Some operations can be shifted in time if the site has enough of a certain resource in stock. A flexible operation can also be rescheduled. However, the size of the stock implies a limitation for the shifting in time. The optimal solution of the operational level depends on the design parameters. A retrofit sensitivity analysis where the optimal schedule has been identified for different design conditions has been developed.'

  title: Simultaneous heat integration and batch process scheduling
  abstract: 'Heat integration of continuous processes is a widely studied research area, where many approaches have been developed to minimize cold and hot utility usage. Batch processes require additional consideration for the planning of the heat exchanger network: since the flows are not always present in the system, their timing has to be considered as well. Both heat integration and scheduling of batch processes are highly complex, their combination is expected to be even higher. Several papers have already addressed the integrated problem in the last decade (Majozi, 2006, Chen and Chang, 2009, Halim and Srinivasan, 2011). Adonyi et. al. (2003) has presented an algorithm to minimize the utility usage for a given time horizon. Their approach assumed, however, that heat exchangers are present for all of the hot-cold stream pairs. Moreover, each hot or cold stream was allowed to be matched with only one hot or cold stream, respectively, further heat demands of the stream had to be satisfied from utilities. The aim of this work is to present an extension of Adonyi et. al.’s approach by allowing the streams to have heat exchanges with multiple other streams. The newly presented approach also takes into account the limitation on the number of availab heat exchangers and their scheduling.'

  title: The role of energy consumption in batch process scheduling
  abstract: 'Makespan minimization or throughput maximization, the most common objectives in batch process scheduling are related to economical aspects; energy consumption or sustainability are not directly taken into account (\[Mendez et al., 2006\] and \[Hegyhati and Friedler, 2010\]). Some of the published methods consider utility cost (Adonyi et al., 2003) or wastewater minimization (Halim and Srinivasan, 2010) during the optimization in addition to economical aspects, nevertheless, the overall energy requirements of a process have never been taken into account. In the present work, a scheduling method is proposed that also considers the energy demands of transfer of liquid materials. In the available mathematical models transfer of intermediate materials has impact only on the overall processing time, and does not express the energy consumption of the transfer. Transfer time of intermediate materials is usually regarded as a fixed value, however, there is an energy -time tradeoff for pumping of intermediate, raw, or product materials. The energy cost of transfer depends on the height difference between the source and destination, the cross-section area of the pipe, viscosity of the material, and the available time. The proposed method integrates pumping strategies into the general scheduling problem to tackle the transfer energy demands. Although this energy is much smaller in magnitude compared to the usual heat energy requirements, still, it is worth investing effort in its reduction, since it is in the form of electrical energy.'

  title: Combinatorial Algorithms of the S-Graph Framework for Batch Scheduling
  abstract: 'Methods for solving batch process scheduling problems have gone through a vast development in the last 2 decades. Most of the published approaches are based on a mixed integer programming formulation. Since the difficulty of scheduling is originated from its combinatorial nature, graphs and combinatorial algorithms are more adequate to represent and solve the problem. Although, combinatorial algorithms and data structures have an enormous literature, these algorithms can not be directly applied to scheduling and further elaboration is needed. In the present work, the combinatorial nature of batch scheduling problems is analyzed. Several combinatorial algorithms are listed that can be considered for the scheduling of batch processes. Their proper adaptation is illustrated via the S-graph framework, in which the main emphasis lies on the combinatorial tools. Furthermore, Place Petri Nets and Timed Automata are also briefly described. An S-graph algorithm has been extensively compared with well-known MILP formulations.'

  title: Using S-graph to address uncertainty in batch plants
  abstract: 'Abstract Processes and markets uncertainties make batch plants a complex environment to manage production activities. Uncertainties may cause deviations and infeasibilities in predefined schedules; this may result in poor planning and inefficient utilization of materials. Consequently, the relevance of explicitly incorporating variability in the scheduling formulation in order to offer more efficient plans and robust decisions to changes has become recognized. This work addresses the batch plants scheduling under exogenous uncertainty. The most widely utilized approach to tackle this problem is stochastic programming; however its solution results in high computational expenses. From another standpoint S-graph, a graph-theoretic approach, has proved to be very efficient to deal with deterministic scheduling. In this work, the S-graph framework is enhanced so that stochastic scheduling problems can be handled. For this purpose, a LP model that is used as performance evaluator has been coupled with S-graph framework. One of the main advantages of the proposed approach is that the search space does not increase according to the number of scenarios considered in the problem. Finally, the potential of the proposed framework is highlighted through two illustrative examples.'

  title: "Practical infeasibility of cross-transfer in batch plants with complex recipes: S-graph vs MILP methods"
  abstract: 'Multipurpose batch processes entail various operational policies that have been widely investigated in published literature. In this paper, no-intermediate-storage (NIS), zero-wait (ZW) and common-intermediate-storage (CIS) operational policies are of particular interest. In all these policies, no dedicated storage facility is available between two consecutive units. Unlike the other operational policies, these particular policies bear some subtle practical infeasibility that has gone unnoticed in literature. In essence, this infeasibility has been reported as optimal, thus assumed to be feasible, by various authors using mathematical programming techniques. It pertains to a unit transferring product to one or more units whilst simultaneously receiving feed from another, which is practically infeasible and as such need not be considered as a possible solution. This feature is particularly conspicuous in batch processes with complex recipes wherein production paths can be in opposite directions. This paper presents the unique feature of the S-graph framework to isolate cross-transfer during optimization, whereas the available mathematical programming methods inherently fail neither to detect nor to eliminate this infeasibility. A few examples taken from published literature are presented for demonstration purposes.'

  title: 'An automated algorithm for throughput maximization under fixed time horizon in multipurpose batch plants: S-Graph approach'
  abstract: 'This paper presents a graph-theoretic technique for scheduling of multipurpose batch processes with the objective of maximizing throughputover a fixed time horizon. The presented technique is based on the S-graph framework which embeds the necessary scheduling information pertaining to recipes of different batches and possible resource allocation. The distinct feature of this contribution is the irrelevance of time horizon discretization which has become traditional in most mathematical programming techniques. Consequently, no presupposition of time points is required, thereby rendering the technique truly continuous in time. A comparison withtime point based techniques is conducted to demonstrate the performance.'
